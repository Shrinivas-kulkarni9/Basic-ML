# Basic ML, DL

This repository contains two python codes, one which trains data.json, and a second file, which will output a json file of labels for an input of features.json
Train.py is a python code which trains on data,json, and test.py uses the parameters from obtained from train.py to output labels for an input.json

There are a couple of basic ML ipynbs

The DeepLearning ipynbs are independent of the above files, and contain implementation of all components like backpropogation, losses etc that any DL model entails. They use only numpy and rest is from scratch.
